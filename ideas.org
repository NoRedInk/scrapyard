* Ideas
** TODO add =find= command that uses exact key match

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   scrapyard --yard /tmp/cache --paths junk find --key key
   #+END_SRC

   Alternatively add =--exact= or some other argument to search?

** TODO  add =update= command that handles combo search & store

   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   scrapyard update --key key --exec "touch bar" --paths bar
   #+END_SRC

   It would search keys for closest match, fetch the cache, run the exec command
   to update the cache contents, and if that succeeded update the first cache
   key with the new contents.

** TODO Allow user to specify log level

   Currently logging is set to DEBUG if =-v= is set, or WARN otherwise

** TODO Improve scanning logging if there are many matching prefixes

   Currently ALL matching files are listed, but it might help clarify to sort
   matches by last modified descending, and only print the first 3 to 5 with an
   ellipse if there are more available.
